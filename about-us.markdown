<b>Who are we?</b><br>
Indivisible For All – South Snohomish County is a non-partisan, grassroots group of unpaid friends and neighbors living in or near South Snohomish County who are joined together by our mutual dedication to resisting the Trump agenda.  Our members hail from Washington State’s Congressional Districts 1, 2, 7 and 9.  We support policies that promote inclusion, fairness, truth, and respect for all and we resist racism, authoritarianism, and corruption in our government.   We resist the Trump agenda by holding our Members of Congress accountable for their actions.  Indivisible members believe that our values, our neighbors and our democracy are threatened by the Trump agenda and, therefore, from our home turfs, we take easy, practical steps to defeat pro-Trump initiatives. <br><br>

<b>What is the Indivisible Guide?</b><br>
<a href="https://www.indivisibleguide.com/">The Indivisible Guide</a> was written in late 2016 as a guide for resisting the Trump agenda by a group of former Congressional staffers who share progressive ideals.  These former Congressional staffers witnessed how the Tea Party successfully slowed and sometimes stopped President Obama’s agenda and have dedicated themselves to apply what they learned to slow and hopefully stop much of the Trump agenda.<br><br>

The Guide advocates for the creation of unpaid, locally led, grassroots organizations focused on each person’s three Members of Congress <i>(sometimes called “MoCs”)</i>, one member of the House of Representatives and two Senators, who themselves are constantly focused on their own need for reelection.  Pressure is applied to each person’s three MoCs through town halls and other public events, in-person visits to district offices, and mass contact via phone calls, emails, letters and petitions.<br><br>

<b>What is the Indivisible Movement?</b><br>
There are approximately 6,000 different groups that have registered with the Indivisible Guide throughout all 50 states of the union.  Some groups prefer to stay small, with only five or 10 friends or family members, while other groups are large and growing with a few thousand members.  Many members choose to join more than one Indivisible group.  Indivisible For All – South Snohomish County has over 60 active members and we hold bi-weekly membership meetings.  We welcome those who embrace the progressive values of inclusion, respect, and fairness.
